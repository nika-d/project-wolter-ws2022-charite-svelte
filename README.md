# project-wolter-ws2022-charite-svelte

this repo contains extracted code from the project on llp-test.charite.de . 

there are unused testdata and maybe dead code somewhere. You can just delete that for your project.

to run locally in your console: 
* npm install
* npm run dev

if errors occur, you need to fix them yourself. the errors in npm scripts come from your machine/system/whatever, not from the project, because the project is very well tested regarding npm scripts.
